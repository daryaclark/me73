# REEKON 2 Shaft Cutting Device
### By: Darya Clark, Hannah Loly, and Julie Katz

Howdy folks! Welcome to the code base for the REEKON 2 Shaft Cutting Device team. This was a senior design project at Tufts University in Fall of 2023. Our device uses a Raspberry Pi 4 and Airtable to use user data to cut stalk sizes of steel rods of diameters 3 and 6 mm to the users specific needs.
